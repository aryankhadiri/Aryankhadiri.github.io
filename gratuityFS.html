									<h1>GRATUITY<br>MANAGMENET SYSTEM
									</h1>
									<p>Fully developed in Django framework. Python for the backend, SQL for the data base and JavaScript for some client side calculations and form vlaidations.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We developed this application in a team of 4 students including me. I was the team lead during this project and the idea was originated from Chelokababi restaurant which I was working for at the time.
                                    We thought that this project will help us deal with real world requirements which could not be arbitary due the needs of the business. So we used this oppurtunity to not only practice the software development
                                    cycle but to actually build something that would be live and running. We also used the MVC design pattern for this application. The basic feautures of the app are:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Database which includes Employees, Tips, Forms and Users models. It stores the inforamtion regarding the closing sales and gratuity figures of each shift as well as the employees who have worked during the shift</li>
                                    <li>It calculates the tips for each person based on their performance index which has been saved under their information in the database</li>
                                    <li>It provides the management of the restaurant with a weekly summary of all the tips entered for every employee as well as access to all the filled forms for modification</li>
