									<h1>PHP SQL and JavaScript<br />

								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I developed this web application in a team of 4 students including me. I was the team lead during this project and the idea was originated from Chelokababi restaurant which I was working for at the time.
                                    We thought that this project will help us deal with real world requirements which could not be arbitarilay chosen due the needs of the business. So we used this oppurtunity to not only practice the software development
									cycle but to actually build something that would be live and running. We also used the MVC design pattern for this application.<br />
