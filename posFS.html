                                <p>This application is a simple POS system which allows the user to create items in the menu and set prices for them. Following that, they can add the 
									Items into their shopping cart As a team of three students, we developed this Java application in our object oriented programming class at SJSU. In addition to learning OOP we wanted to learn more about the GUI design 
									in Java and we used the Swing library for that.  <br/>

                                    <li>The Database which includes Employees, Tips, Forms and Users models. It stores the information regarding the closing sales and gratuity figures of each shift as well as the employees who have worked during the shift.</li>
                                    <li>It calculates the tips for each person based on their performance index which has been saved under their information in the database.</li>
                                    <li>It provides the management of the restaurant with a weekly summary of all the tips entered for every employee as well as access to all the filled forms for modification.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <h3> My Role</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>About 80 percent of the front-end design. Including the homepages, schedule pages and the overall theme of the application.</li>
									<li>Also about 80 percent of the backend programming including the authentication process, forms submissions, entering and editing schedules and adding and modifying employees information.</li>
									<li>Database structure. From creating the classes and their attributes and functions which would allow the application to make modifications to the database.</li>
