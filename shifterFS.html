                                <h3>Summary</h3>
                                <p>I was part of a team of 4 other students who contributed to the development of this application. I was the team lead on this project and we thought the process of developing a scheduling application
                                    will be a great learning process for all of us. This project was an assignment of Computer Engineering class 131 of San Jose State Univeristy.
                                    We chose the Agile Project Management approach for this project and consistently used the features of the github. we also integerated Travis Ci in this application for our testing process.
                                    The application roughly took about 3 months to finish and is currently deployed on Heroku.<br/>

                                <h3>Features</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Database which includes Employees, Tips, Forms and Users models. It stores the inforamtion regarding the closing sales and gratuity figures of each shift as well as the employees who have worked during the shift.</li>
                                    <li>It calculates the tips for each person based on their performance index which has been saved under their information in the database.</li>
                                    <li>It provides the management of the restaurant with a weekly summary of all the tips entered for every employee as well as access to all the filled forms for modification.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <h3> My Role</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>About 80 percent of the front-end design. Inclduing the homepages, schedule pages and the overal theme of the application.</li>
									<li>Also about 80 percent of the backend programming inlcuding the authentication process, forms submissions, entering and editing schedules and adding and modifying employees information.</li>
									<li>Database structure. From creating the classes and thier attributes and functions which would allow the application to make modifications to the database.</li>
